This project is based on a visualization [Zack Sultan](http://blog.zacksultan.com/) (our previous art director) created one day. In the spirit of his original design, the new Creativity Levels are designed to precisely visualize the net energy coursing through our team.

Some day, I'll connect the visualization to a slack bot, but in the meantime, it exists as a static page. The idea is that with a simple slash command, anyone could update the status of the meter.
